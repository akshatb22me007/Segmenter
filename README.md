# UNet Image Segmenter  

## Overview  
This repository implements an image segmentation model using **U-Net**, a widely used deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation. The model is designed to segment objects from images with high accuracy.  

## Features  
- **U-Net architecture** for precise image segmentation  
- **PyTorch implementation** for flexibility and scalability   

## TODO
- [X] Added Encoder and Decoder Block
- [X] Added UNet Architecture
- [ ] To add data download script
- [ ] To add data loading script
- [ ] To include data augmentaion technique for generalization
- [ ] To add train.py
